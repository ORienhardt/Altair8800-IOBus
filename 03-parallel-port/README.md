## Parallel port (88-PIO)

The 88-PIO card offered one 8-bit parallel input port and one 
8-bit parallel input port together with handshake signals.
This card uses the same ICs (Intel 8212) as the 88-PIO card
and therefore is 100% software compatible except that the card
can not cause interrupts in the emulator.
